This was an assignment in one of my design courses at Algonquin College. We were to design an app for [Winterlude](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/winterlude.html), a large winter festival that takes place in Ottawa. The prototype was built using Adobe XD, and features a handful of screens.
