[GC-Tortilla](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gc-tortilla) is a React library designed to help speed up the development of Government of Canada applications by providing pre-approved branded components. All elements in the components are fully customizable so they can be used by different teams with their own branding as needed. With GC-Tortilla you get a Splash Screen, Header Brand Bar and a Footer all of which are brand ready. The splash screen is unique in that it will use LocalStorage so that once the user set's their initial language preference they will not be forced to re-visit the splash screen every time they access the app. You can utilize all components pre-packaged together by importing GC-Tortilla or you have the option to import GCSplashScreen, GCHeader and GCFooter separately to use them on their own. This library is hosted on NPM and showcases my ability to write clear & concise documentation.
