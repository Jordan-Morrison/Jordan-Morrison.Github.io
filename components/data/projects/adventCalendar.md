This advent calendar was a gift for my family and everyday of December, up until Christmas it would give them a hint as to what their presents were going to be. The calendar was full of animations with snow constantly falling and gift wrap when opening a new day on the calendar. This project also featured a backend with email & password authentication using Firebase. This protected any leaks as only data up and until that day would be sent to the app from the server.
