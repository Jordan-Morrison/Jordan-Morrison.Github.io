Open Call was a project initiated and quickly built during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as a lifeline to smaller organizations and municipalities by providing them with essential COVID-19 related tools and resources. Collaborating with the Canadian Digital Service, Code for Canada and the Canada School of Public Service, I volunteered outside of my normal duties, taking on the role of lead developer for this crucial initiative. Open Call functioned as a comprehensive catalog of valuable COVID-related resources, tools and APIs powered by a simple yet powerful backend built on the Google sheets API - easily enabling non-technical staff to add new resources. My dedication and impact was so significant that it led to being scouted by the Chief Medical Officer of Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam to contribute to the development of a data management tool for handling the influx of COVID-19 data her team was receiving. The tool has since been decommissioned and with the API being taken down, the loading indicator now spins where the catalogue items were.
