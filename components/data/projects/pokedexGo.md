Starting out as a simple assignment, Pokédex Go grew into a large side project. We were to build a basic app with a list and detail view. I chose to base my app on the popular game Pokémon Go, creating a wiki like app for players. After submitting my assignment I began adding more features and screens, integrating tools like Google Analytics and added a JSON server used to detect updates and news items. I then rolled out the app by advertising on social media and began having daily users!
