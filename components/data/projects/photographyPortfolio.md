Built as my own portfolio, [jordanmorrison.ca](https://jordanmorrison.ca) is a simple yet captivating website utilizing the latest web technologies. With millions of views on my social media it was important to create the site with lightweightness in mind as as the magnitude of visitors could quickly drive up hosting costs. With this, I'm proud to say I've done just that as the site remains online at near zero cost. Feature wise the site has a custom photo grid component, showcasing a selection of my photos along with a dynamic dark mode that automatically adjusts according to the user's browser and device settings. While simple, this site helps to create an immersive and visually stunning experience for visitors to explore my photographic work all while staying lightweight to keep costs down.
