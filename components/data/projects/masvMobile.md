MASV Mobile is a team based applied research project through Algonquin College, being built for [MASV](https://massive.io) to compliment their existing products. The goal for the app was to support MASV Portals, which are setup by companies & creative professionals who wish to crowdsource files. Portals are custom branded to reflect the hosting party, and can be accessed by users to upload files. My role was project lead, where I led our team of six throughout the entire design and development process. I worked closely with the team in all aspects as we designed & developed the app.
